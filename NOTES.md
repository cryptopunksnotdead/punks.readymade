# Notes

## Todos

- [ ] check if `+id` is always a number type (for auto-conversion) e.g. `#event+id`
- [ ] add check for `#geo` and `+lat`, `+lon` (for auto-conversion) to floats
- [ ] add type converter for `#date` (e.g. `#date+start`, `#date+reported`, etc.) - support 2017-12-11 and 11/14/2017 for now?
- [ ] header converter for symbols - turn `+` into `_x_` or `_I_` or into `$` - why? why not? (check if `$` supported in ruby inline?
